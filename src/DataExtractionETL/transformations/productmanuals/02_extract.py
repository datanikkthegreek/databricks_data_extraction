Extract product specifications from this power tool manual. Focus only on the English language sections.
All extracted values (including product_name) must be in English. Look for technical data in specification
tables, feature lists, and product descriptions throughout the entire document. If a specification is
mentioned anywhere in the document (not just in tables), extract it. If multiple models are listed,
extract the primary model.
